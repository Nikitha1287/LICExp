# **Circuit1**
## **Aim:**
To perform DC, transient, and AC analyses on a CS amplifier circuit and use LT Spice to extract the different parameters involved.
## **COMPONENTS**:  
Mosfet-nmos4,pmos4,voltage sources-0.9V,1.8V, connection wires, Resistor-1k,   
## **CIRCUIT DIAGRAM**:

## **PROCEDURE**:  
1. Create a folder named projects. Save the LTSPICE file in this folder. Save the tsmc018 library file also in the same folder.
2. Add the components according to the circuit diagram. Two voltage sources, one nMOS, a load resitor(1k).
3. Name the nMOS as CMOSN as per the library file.
4.
