# **EXPERIMENT 6: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT:**

# **AIM:**

 Design and Analyze Current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit. V<sub>DD</sub>(Power Supply)= 1.8V, P<= 1mW and Gain: A<sub>v</sub> > -10V/V. Perform DC Analysis, Transient analysis and AC analysis. 

 
# **CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT:**
Current Mirror circuit is designed to copy a current to an active device by controlling the current through another active device. The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits. Theoretically a perfect current mirror is an inverting current amplifier. This circuit generates a single copy or number of copies of the reference current. They are used in Integrated circuits to bias the amplifiers. 
**In order to avoid supply and temperature dependence, a bandgap reference can provide a “golden current” while requiring a few tens of devices. We must therefore seek a 
method of “copying” the golden current without duplicating the entire bandgap circuitry. Current mirrors serve this purpose.**
