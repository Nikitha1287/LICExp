# **EXPERIMENT 6: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT:**

# **AIM:**

 Design and Analyze Current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit. V<sub>DD</sub>(Power Supply)= 1.8V, P<= 1mW and Gain: A<sub>v</sub> > -10V/V. Perform DC Analysis, Transient analysis and AC analysis. 

 
# **CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT:**
Current Mirror circuit is designed 
The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits.
