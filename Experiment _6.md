# **CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT:**
## **INTRODUCTION:**
Current Mirror circuit is designed to copy a current to an active device by controlling the current through another active device with the same current characteristics. The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits. Theoretically a perfect current mirror is an inverting current amplifier. This circuit generates a single copy or number of copies of the reference current. They are used in Integrated circuits to bias the amplifiers. 
**In order to avoid supply and temperature dependence, a bandgap reference can provide a “golden current” while requiring a few tens of devices. We must therefore seek a 
method of “copying” the golden current without duplicating the entire bandgap circuitry. Current mirrors serve this purpose.**

**In the above figure, the golden current generated by a bandgap reference is “read” by the current mirror and a copy having the same characteristics as those of IREF is produced. For example, Icopy = IREF or 2IREF.**

There are Two types of current mirror circuit:

**In this experiment, our main focus is on MOS Current Mirror Circuits and including it as a load in the differential amplifier circuit.**
